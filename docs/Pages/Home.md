# Crimson Game Engine

Crimson is a 3D game engine written in modern C++. It's still very work-in-progress, and it's not at the point were it could be used in a game (yet). I'm using this website to document the engine as I build it.

In the meantime, you can check the [GitHub](https://github.com/georgelam6/Crimson)
